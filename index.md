Liquid is an open-source template language
created by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) and written in Ruby.
It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefronts.

Liquid has been in production use since June 2006 and is now used by many other
hosted web applications.
