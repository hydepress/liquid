Safe, customer facing template language for flexible web apps

# Liquid Template Language Documentation (Book Edition)

by Tobias Luetke, et al 


> **Note:** The book edition is still an early release and a work-in-progess.


This is the [(official) documentation](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/tree/gh-pages)
for the Liquid template language
reformatted in a single-page book edition.

See the [source repo](https://github.com/hydepress/hydepress.github.io) for how
the book gets auto-built with "plain" Jekyll - of course - and hosted on GitHub Pages.
